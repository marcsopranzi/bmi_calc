# Data load for a BMI flag calculator.

This a simplistic approach to a bmi calculator, where a json file is loaded to be
classified and printed.

This code can be run locally executing the setup_env.sh file. First, you you must change
the file properties with `chmod +x setup_env.sh` . Once the file is executed the project 
dependencies will be installed and ready for use. 
The sample data is in the data folder and it can be processed running `python3 bmi_calc.py`
